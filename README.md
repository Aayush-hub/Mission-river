## Our idea which is consist of an web that will help industries, authorities and communities to identify the hazardous chemicals and all other elements, its possible source and remedy.  
- :smile: First part of this project is an web (through url) which will be used to see data about heavy metals, minerals and other trace elements from the sample water of River.


- :relaxed: Second part of this project will show the data to the user which can be used for further analysis.
- :globe_with_meridians: The web will also provide database tracing of possible sources of pollution in nearby areas using geographical map (NASAEARTH).
- :earth_asia: To analyze the source of pollution we are also using NASA earth explorer  as it will provide us the map based data of the location user searched for.
- :sunglasses: It will also share possible remedies to the user and will inform about less polluted sources in area.
